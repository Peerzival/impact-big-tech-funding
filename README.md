# What Impact Does Big Tech Funding Have on AI Research? A Scholarly Document Analysis

## The Repository

This repository contains the code and datasets used in the thesis "What Impact Does Big Tech Funding Have on AI Research? A Scholarly Document Analysis". My work analyzes the citational impact of Big Tech funding on
AI research through a set of comprehensive analyses of citational patterns in scientific literature,highlighting growing tendency within the AI research community to engage with industry-funded work. However, this trend comes at the expense of diversity, as industry-funded research disproportionately cites itself while neglecting a broader range of older, potentially foundational work.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets by age of citation, funding agencies per conference, category, and year, as well as cited fields, citation relationships, and more.
- `figures/`: Directory containing generated figures and plots.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with main plots and analysis from the paper.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the datasets, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. A list of dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open and execute the `analysis.ipynb` notebook for visualizations and further analysis.

## Usage

### Analysis and Visualization

Open `analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment with R (for example with GitHub Codespaces) to see the key plots and analysis performed in the study.
