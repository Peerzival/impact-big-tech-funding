# What Impact Does Big Tech Funding Have on AI Research? A Scholarly Document Analysis

## The Repository

This repository contains the code and datasets used in the paper "What Impact Does Big Tech Funding Have on AI Research? A Scholarly Document Analysis". My work analyzes citation patterns across various funding types to investigate trends in citation ages, highlighting the growing focus on recent literature at the expense of older, foundational works.

## Repository Structure

- `data/`: Contains datasets by field, including citation relationships, grant information, institutional affiliations, and more.
- `figures/`: Directory containing generated figures and plots.
- `analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with main plots and analysis from the paper.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis or explore the datasets, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed. A list of dependencies can be found in `requirements.txt`.
3. Open and execute the `analysis.ipynb` notebook for visualizations and further analysis.

## Usage

### Analysis and Visualization

Open `analysis.ipynb` in a Jupyter environment with R (for example with GitHub Codespaces) to see the key plots and analysis performed in the study.
